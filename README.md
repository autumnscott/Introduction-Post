# Introduction-Post

As part of my inspiration for creating this blog, Adobe Create Magazine has been there time and time again feeding me the best of today’s art. I highly recommend their magazine to anyone the slightest bit interested in art. I actually arrived at my topic today through inspiration from one of their stories. The article that got me inspired talked about a poster series created by Brad Woodard The series included 59 poster designs. All 59 posters represent a national park. It got me thinking about what a wonderful concept that was. To fully capture a complete iteration of an entire park in just once image. That led me to think about some of the parks I’ve become the most familiar with in my life time. In fact, I drive by a state park every single day. How interesting would it be to take a place I’m so familiar with and think about it in a nonobjective way. To truly capture the pure essence of the park. That was an idea I wanted to run with. I wanted to create my own poster of a park that I had known and loved. Below I have displayed a few images of Woodard’s posters as well as one of my own. I plan on creating my own series of posters representing the different perspectives of Missouri’s Roaring River state park.
